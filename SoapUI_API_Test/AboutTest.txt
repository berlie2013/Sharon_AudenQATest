In this project i have used WSDL Address:http://currencyconverter.kowabunga.net/converter.asmx?WSDL
Currency rate date used is : 2019-06-07

Created a test suite which have the following
 1. USD to GBP converion (Script assertion is used to validate the conversion rate)
 2. Property Transfer - used to trasfer USD from request1 to request2
 3. GBP to USD conversion (Script assertion is used to validate the conversion rate)
