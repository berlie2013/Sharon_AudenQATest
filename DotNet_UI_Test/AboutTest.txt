- This project is written in C# on .NET IDE
- Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) specflow is used to write tests
- Page Object model is uses as framework, as this gives more readability, maintainability, code reusability.


The solution consits of 4 sub-projects
 - Page (All page elements and its methods)
 - Driver (Driver actions)
 - Common (shared methods and properties)
 - Tests (Consists of feature files,Test steps)

All tests are in one feature file. And used only one stepdefinition. I know there is much more i can improve in this in case of execution time.

# The following required to run the test
 
-- Visual studio
 
Installed from nuget packages
  - Nunit
  - Selenium Webdriver
  - Selenium Support  
  - Specflow
  - SpecFlow.Tools.MsBuild.Generation

Extentions and updates:
  - SpecFlow for visual studio 2017
  - Nunit3 Test adapter

All suggesions are welcome.
